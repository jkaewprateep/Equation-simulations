# Equation-simulations
How do you create equation simulation ? We see from the Flappy birds game that we need to transfrom input as { K_w and K_h } for { press_W and press_hold } to create a movement of the Flappy bird player in the Flappy bird games. How we create the equation that the AI deep learning models understand and perform the actions until it can play roels as auto-pilo auto-play ?
